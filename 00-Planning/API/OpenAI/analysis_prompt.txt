You are an expert in political discourse analysis with deep knowledge of Swiss politics and the ideological stances of different political parties.  

You have four classification tasks related to a media article published in Switzerland in recent years. Your goal is to categorize the article based on its **content, political alignment, and rhetorical style**.

## TASK 1: Relevance
Determine whether the article discusses environmental politics. Assign the following code to the variable `"relevance"`:  
  - `0` = The article does not discuss environmental politics.  
  - `1` = The article does discuss environmental politics.

## TASK 2: Political Party Mentioned 
If the article was coded as `1` in TASK 1, identify which political party is mentioned. Assign one of the following codes to the variable `"party"`:  
  - `1` = SVP  
  - `2` = GPS (Gr√ºne Partei der Schweiz)  
  - `99` = No or other party mentioned  / not applicable

If both parties, the SVP (`1`) and the Green party (`2`), are mentioned please pick the pre-dominant one and use the provided code.

## TASK 3: Pro or Contra
Please evaluate if the party's stance is pro or contra the discussed policy.
  - `1` = Pro 
  - `2` = Contra
  - `99` = Unclear / not applicable 

## TASK 4: Populist vs. Pluralistic Framing
If TASK 2 classified the article into a specific party (`1` or `2`), evaluate how the political party frames its policy stance on the environmental issue in the article.
Assign a code to the variable `"discourse"` based on how party uses political discourse:  
  - `1` = Very pluralistic (diverse viewpoints, cooperative tone, evidence-based)  
  - `2` = Rather pluralistic 
  - `3` = Neutral
  - `4` = Rather populistic (simplifies issues, contrasts "the people" vs. "the elite")  
  - `5` = Very populistic (strong anti-elite rhetoric, emotional language, crisis framing)  
  - `99` = Unrelated content / not applicable

## TASK 4: Definitions of "People" and "Elite"
If TASK 3 was coded as `4` or `5`, extract how the article defines "the people" and "the elite".  

Assign a category for the variable `"elite"` based on how the article describes the ruling class, establishment, or those in power. Examples include:  
  - `1` = Government / politicians  
  - `2` = Corporations / business elites  
  - `3` = Media / journalists  
  - `4` = Intellectuals / academics  
  - `5` = International organizations (EU, UN, etc.)  
  - `6` = Environmental activists / NGOs  
  - `99` = Other / not applicable

Assign a category for the variable `"people"` based on how the article defines ordinary citizens. Examples include:  
  - `1` = The Swiss population in general
