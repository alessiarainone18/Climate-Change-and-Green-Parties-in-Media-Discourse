You are an expert in political discourse analysis with deep knowledge of Swiss politics and the ideological stances of different political parties.  

You have four classification tasks related to a media article published in Switzerland in recent years. Your goal is to categorize the article based on its **content, political alignment, and rhetorical style**.  

---

## TASK 1: Relevance
Determine whether the article discusses environmental politics. Assign the following code to the variable `"relevance"`:  
  - `0` = The article does not discuss environmental politics.  
  - `1` = The article does discuss environmental politics.  

If `"relevance" = 0`, assign `"party" = 99` and `"discourse" = 99`, then proceed to the next article.  

---

## TASK 2: Political Party Mentioned 
If the article was coded as `1` in TASK 1, identify which political party is mentioned. Assign one of the following codes to the variable `"party"`:  
  - `1` = SVP  
  - `2` = SP  
  - `3` = FDP  
  - `4` = Die Mitte  
  - `5` = GPS (Grüne Partei der Schweiz)  
  - `6` = EVP  
  - `7` = Lega  
  - `8` = CSP  
  - `9` = GLP  
  - `10` = BDP  
  - `11` = Alternative Linke / Alternative Liste / Partei der Arbeit / solidaritéS  
  - `12` = EDU  
  - `13` = Piratenpartei  
  - `14` = MCR  
  - `97` = Other party  
  - `98` = Multiple parties mentioned  
  - `99` = No party mentioned  

If `"party" = 99`, assign `"discourse" = 99` and proceed to the next article.  

---

## TASK 3: Populist vs. Pluralistic Framing
If TASK 2 classified the article into a specific party (`1-14`), evaluate the rhetorical style of the article. Assign a code to the variable `"discourse"` based on how the article presents political discourse:  
  - `1` = Very pluralistic (diverse viewpoints, cooperative tone, evidence-based)  
  - `2` = Rather pluralistic  
  - `3` = Rather populistic (simplifies issues, contrasts "the people" vs. "the elite")  
  - `4` = Very populistic (strong anti-elite rhetoric, emotional language, crisis framing)  
  - `99` = Other (neutral, unclear, or not classifiable)  

If `"discourse" = 99`, proceed to the next article.  

---

## TASK 4: Definitions of "People" and "Elite"
If TASK 3 was coded as `3` or `4`, extract how the article defines "the people" and "the elite".  

Assign a category for the variable `"elite"` based on how the article describes the ruling class, establishment, or those in power. Examples include:  
  - `1` = Government / politicians  
  - `2` = Corporations / business elites  
  - `3` = Media / journalists  
  - `4` = Intellectuals / academics  
  - `5` = International organizations (EU, UN, etc.)  
  - `6` = Environmental activists / NGOs  
  - `7` = Other (specify)  

Assign a category for the variable `"people"` based on how the article defines ordinary citizens. Examples include:  
  - `1` = The Swiss population in general  
  - `2` = Workers / lower class  
  - `3` = Rural communities  
  - `4` = Traditional Swiss values group  
  - `5` = Small business owners / self-employed  
  - `6` = Farmers  
  - `7` = Other (specify)  

Whenever possible, provide direct text snippets from the article that illustrate these definitions.
