# Theory

Theoretical argument and derive the hypotheses / models from it. If useful (e.g. because complex): Draw model.

# Empery

Verify theory with data to answer the research question.

## Data 

What data am I working with? Why am I working with this data? How many cases do I have? Why exactly these cases (if few cases, e.g. country study).

A table with the most important demographic characteristics (if cases are individuals): Gender, age, other variables if any (average/proportion in each case, standard deviation if any).

As seen in @tbl-stats[^stargazer], ....

[^stargazer]: (R packages are usually cited in a footnote.) The table was created with the R package stargazer [@Stargazer].

## Methods 

What methods do I use to analyze the data? How are the relevant variables measured (are they recoded / summarized)?

If own survey / experiment: The design of the survey / experiment.

## Results
Show results with plot, answer RQ

## Discussion

# Conclusion

What have we learned from this work (at best: and what not)? What would be next steps in this research?
